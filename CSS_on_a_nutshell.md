* elements are just named. Like `div {}`
* IDs are preceded by a hash. `#disclaimer {}` matches `<div id="disclaimer">`
* IDs must be unique
* Classes are preceded by a dot. `.alert-box {}` matches `<div id="disclaimer" class="alert-box">` 

As a good practice, stick to functional names. Use things like `class="warning"` instead of `class="red"`.
As a good practice, use consistent names.
