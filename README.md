# mydocs
Just a placeholder for my own documents and notes, along with my python samples, bash scripts, ansible playbooks and other stuff.


* `ansible` contains generic ansible playbooks and templates
* `bash` contains tiny scripts and code examples that can be reused for bigger scripts
* `python` contains small python programs and reusable functions
* `javascript` contains small JS programs
* `howto` contains useful documentation about everyday topics in the life of a DevOps engineer


This is a personal useful repo and also some sort of a public portfolio. 

Feel free to browse. If you find anything useful, adapt it to your own needs.
