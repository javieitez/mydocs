## Create a systemd service

Create a file named `/etc/systemd/system/myservice.service`

```ini
[Unit]
Description=Description of my service
After=network.target
StartLimitIntervalSec=0
[Service]
Type=simple
Restart=always
RestartSec=1
User=myuser
ExecStart=/path/to/my/script

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
```
Thatâ€™s it. There's no need to `chmod` it to apply any special permissions.

We can now start the service:
```
systemctl start myservice
```
